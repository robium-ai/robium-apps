"""Regression test for the Task 4 Step 3a workspace reachability probe.

That probe (originally run at the REPL and only recorded as a transcript in
task-4-report.md) found that menagerie's own default box spawn (0.5, 0, 0.03)
is unreachable for the SO-101's short reach, and that the bin's first
candidate position (0.35, 0.22, 0.0) failed at the far (+x,+y) corner at lift
height — which is why the bin ended up at (0.35, 0.16, 0.0). Nothing caught
that automatically; it was found by hand. This commits the same probe as a
test so a future scene change (e.g. a menagerie re-fetch, or hand-editing
scene_pick.xml) that silently breaks reachability again fails loudly here
instead.

`solve_ik` does NOT raise on an unreachable target — it returns its
locally-optimal best effort — so "reachable" must be checked via the residual
between the solved pose's site position and the target, not by absence of an
exception.
