"""M0 spike guards. Marked `slow` — deselected from the default run.

Each test here does REAL SmolVLA forward passes at ~9 s apiece on CPU: together
they were 268 s, 56% of the whole suite, re-deriving numbers already committed
in docs/architecture-brief.md. They are a benchmark, not a regression test.

Run them deliberately: `make spike-test`.
