"""Demo session gateway — one process, one port (8765), per the demo spec.

FastAPI implementing indoor-navigation's session contract (so robium-website's
Controls/demoClient/orchestrator reuse unchanged) + the Gradio app mounted at
/ui. Unlike indoor-navigation's gateway there is no WebSocket tunnel: the "viewer" is
the Gradio app itself, and "busy" means an episode is executing.

Contract (mirrors indoor-navigation's scripts/demo_gateway.py):
  POST /start?session=U    -> claim; foreign session while a run executes -> 503
  GET  /status?session=U   -> indoor-navigation's JSON shape; foreign session -> 409
  POST /shutdown?session=U -> foreign -> 403; own -> exit the process
  /ui                      -> the Gradio app (iframed by the website)

Runs identically native (uv, MPS) and in the demo container (CPU) — no
container-only assumptions: shutdown exits THIS process (not PID 1 blindly),
readiness is "checkpoint + env loaded" printed as DEMO READY (the
orchestrator's readyLog), device comes from config.INFERENCE_DEVICE.
