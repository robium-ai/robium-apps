"""One-episode runner for the demo page — the piece between the Gradio UI
and the proven env/oracle/policy code.

Loads the model ONCE (SmolVLA checkpoint + processors) so a Run click costs
an episode, not a model load — but constructs a FRESH SO101PickEnv inside
each run, in the thread that executes it. That is deliberate, not waste:
macOS MuJoCo GL contexts (CGL) are thread-affine, and Gradio executes each
request on whatever worker thread is free — a renderer created on the boot
thread DEADLOCKS (hangs forever in cgl `make_current`, no error) the first
time another thread renders with it. Verified 2026-07-15 with a faulthandler
stack dump; env construction is ~100 ms, invisible next to the episode.

Logs each step to a caller-provided `rr.RecordingStream` (NOT the global
recording — every Run gets its own recording id so the embedded viewer's
timeline is per-run) and yields after every control step so the caller can
stream incremental bytes to the browser.

The inference path deliberately mirrors policy/evaluate.py — same
preprocessor/postprocessor pipelines, same raw-key batch contract (the
checkpoint's own preprocessor renames wrist/scene internally; see that
module's docstring). It reuses evaluate's `_to_batch` rather than copying it.
