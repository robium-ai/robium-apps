"""Roll a SmolVLA checkpoint out in the sim and score it.

Our own loop rather than `lerobot-eval`: SO101PickEnv is not a registered
LeRobot env type, and registering it buys nothing here.

The policy sees ONLY pixels + joint state + the task string. No ground truth.
That is the whole claim being tested.

Inference contract (verified against the installed lerobot==0.6.0, Task 9):
  - `SmolVLAPolicy.select_action(batch)` does NOT tokenize/normalize/batch a
    raw observation dict itself — that happens in a separate processor
    pipeline built by `make_pre_post_processors`, which must be run over the
    batch BEFORE `select_action` and over its output action AFTER (mirrors
    `spike/bench_policy.py`'s `_dummy_batch` + `lerobot/scripts/lerobot_eval.py`).
  - Loading the pipelines `from` the checkpoint path (`pretrained_path=`)
    pulls the checkpoint's own saved `policy_preprocessor.json` /
    `policy_postprocessor.json` rather than building fresh ones.

Camera renaming (empirically determined against the local Task 8 smoke
checkpoint, `outputs/train/smolvla_so101_smoke/checkpoints/000005/pretrained_model`):
  `policy_preprocessor.json`'s FIRST step is a `rename_observations_processor`
  with CAMERA_RENAME_MAP baked in from training. So the checkpoint's saved
  preprocessor ALREADY renames wrist->camera1 / scene->camera2 internally —
  we feed it the env's raw wrist/scene keys, not pre-renamed ones. Renaming
  ourselves first would just hand the pipeline's own rename step keys it no
  longer recognizes. `CAMERA_RENAME_MAP` is still passed explicitly via
  `preprocessor_overrides`, matching how lerobot's own `lerobot_eval.py`
  re-asserts `cfg.rename_map` even after loading pretrained processors — this
  keeps the rename sourced from `config.py`, not from trusting a JSON blob.
  The missing third camera (`camera3`) is padded automatically by
  `SmolVLAPolicy.prepare_images` from `policy.config.empty_cameras` — no
  batch key needed for it.
