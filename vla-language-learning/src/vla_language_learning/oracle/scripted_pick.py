"""Ground-truth-driven pick-and-place. The demo's "before" and its data source.

This is NOT a policy — it can see the cube's exact pose, which is precisely why
it works and why it proves nothing about learning. It exists to (a) put a moving
arm on screen on day one and (b) generate the demonstrations SmolVLA trains on.

Getting this to grasp at all took three corrections, each found by measurement
rather than by reading the MJCF. All three are load-bearing; drop any one and the
success rate collapses to zero:

  1. THE PEDESTAL (scene_pick.xml). With the cube on the floor, the 5-DOF arm can
     only reach it with the fingers pitched ~32 deg BELOW horizontal, and at that
     pitch the fixed jaw's collision-mesh shaft sweeps straight through the cube:
     the arm stalls (shoulder_lift/elbow_flex saturated at their +-2.94 N*m
     forcerange) and the jaws close on empty air.

  2. THE WRIST ROLL (`_solve_roll`). Position-only IK leaves `wrist_roll` free and
     it lands near 0 — where the jaws' pinch axis is ~91% VERTICAL. The jaws were
     trying to span the cube's 6 cm HEIGHT with a 4.2 cm aperture: geometrically
     impossible, which is why they always closed on air. Rolling the wrist so the
     pinch axis is HORIZONTAL makes them span the cube's 4 cm WIDTH instead. This
     single fix took the oracle from 0/10 to 8/10.

  3. THE GRASP OFFSET (ORACLE_GRASP_LOCAL). The `gripperframe` site is NOT the
     grasp point; the real one was calibrated empirically. See config.py.

Approach is along the FINGER AXIS, not straight down — descending vertically
lands the jaw shaft on top of the cube.

# GRIPPER POLARITY — determined empirically, NOT from any doc (the upstream
# SO-ARM100 repo says 0=closed/100=open but admits its MJCF does not reflect
# that, so it cannot be trusted). Method: drive the gripper joint to each end of
# the actuator's ctrlrange and measure the fingertip gap
# (fixed_jaw_sph_tip1 <-> moving_jaw_sph_tip1):
#
#     ctrl = -0.17453 (ctrlrange LOW)  -> fingertip gap 0.0041 m  => CLOSED
#     ctrl =  0.0                      -> fingertip gap 0.0163 m
#     ctrl = +1.74533 (ctrlrange HIGH) -> fingertip gap 0.1334 m  => OPEN
#
# So ctrlrange LOW = closed, HIGH = open — no swap needed. Polarity was never the
# bug; the jaws opened and closed correctly all along. Them settling at the
# fully-closed command was the *symptom* of closing on empty air.
