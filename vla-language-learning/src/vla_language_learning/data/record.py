"""Roll the oracle out N times and write a LeRobotDataset v3.

Scripted-oracle collection, not teleop: we own the MJCF, so the cube's pose is
known, and 75 episodes take minutes unattended and are regenerable after any
scene tweak. Teleop would be an hour of tedium with variable quality.

API note (Task 7 Step 1, installed lerobot==0.6.0): the brief's sample code
called ``dataset.add_frame(frame, task=TASK)`` — that signature does not
exist. The installed ``LeRobotDataset.add_frame(self, frame: dict) -> None``
takes ONLY the frame dict, and its docstring says the frame "must include a
'task' key"; the writer does ``frame.pop("task")`` internally. So the task
string goes INSIDE the per-frame dict, not as a call kwarg. ``save_episode``
similarly takes no ``task`` argument in this release.
