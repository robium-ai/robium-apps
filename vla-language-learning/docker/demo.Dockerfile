# The demo container: the session gateway + Gradio/Rerun UI on :8765.
# CPU-only by design — Docker on macOS cannot see MPS and the (future) cloud
# target has no GPU either; native MPS runs use `make demo` instead.
#
# Build via `make demo-image` — the checkpoint repos are private, so the bake
# step needs an HF token as a BuildKit secret (never an ENV/ARG: those persist
# in image history).
