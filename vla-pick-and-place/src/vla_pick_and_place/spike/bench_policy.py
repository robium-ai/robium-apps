"""M0 spike: SmolVLA forward-pass latency on this machine.

Spec risk 1 — the demo's core unverified assumption. HF's "runs on a MacBook"
is a marketing claim, not a measurement, and no published benchmark exists.

Measure THREE numbers:
  make spike-policy            # MPS native + CPU native
  make spike-policy-container  # CPU inside linux/arm64 — the one that decides

The container number is decisive because Docker on macOS cannot see MPS, so the
demo container is CPU on the Mac *and* CPU on Cloud Run.

The bar is POLICY_LATENCY_CEILING_S (~1 s), not 30 Hz: action chunking means one
forward pass yields ~50 actions ≈ 1.7 s of robot motion at 30 FPS.

        ``observation.images.camera{1,2,3}``, each ``(3, 256, 256)`` — not
        the env's own "wrist"/"scene" camera names. Env-specific camera
        naming/remapping is a Task 4+ concern, not this latency
        measurement's, so keys are taken from
