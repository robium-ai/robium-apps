"""The demo's Gradio app: instruction -> controller -> Run -> embedded Rerun.

Mounted at /ui by gateway.py (gr.mount_gradio_app); the website's Robot pane
iframes it. Built against gradio_rerun 0.34.1's streaming pattern (verified
2026-07-15 from rerun-io/gradio-rerun-viewer's README): each Run constructs a
fresh RecordingStream, logs into it, and yields `stream.read()` bytes to the
`Rerun(streaming=True)` component.

Honesty is part of the layout: the trained controller is labeled as the
100-step pipe-test checkpoint that does NOT complete the task yet, and the
oracle is labeled scripted-and-blind. No success theater.

every step streams onto the Rerun timeline below (cameras, joint state,
actions) — scrub it when the episode ends.

- The policy was trained on episodes of *"{TASK}"* — off-distribution
  instructions produce honest flailing, not magic.

  20k-step fine-tune is a deliberate later spend and will slot in here).
