"""Damped-least-squares (Levenberg-Marquardt) inverse kinematics for the SO-101 arm.

Pulled forward from Task 5 (the scripted oracle needs it to move the gripper to a
target position) because Task 4's Step 3a reachability probe needs it first: the
SO-101 is a small arm and any spawn/bin coordinate that is not actually reachable
will silently degrade into "the arm stops short" much later, deep inside the
oracle, unless it is checked here.

A pure function of (model, data, site_name, target_pos) — no SO101PickEnv
dependency, so it is usable standalone from a throwaway probe script.

IMPORTANT: this solves position only, for the 5 ARM joints (qpos[0:5]); the
gripper (qpos[5], the 6th DOF) is not part of the kinematic chain to the
`gripperframe` site's position and is left untouched. It does NOT raise on an
unreachable target — a target outside the arm's reach simply fails to converge
within `tol` and the best-effort (locally-optimal) joint config is returned. Callers
that need to know whether a target was actually reached must check the resulting
site position against the target themselves (see the Step 3a probe in the task
brief, or `tests/test_reachability.py`).
