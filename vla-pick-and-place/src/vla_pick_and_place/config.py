# The cube rests on the PEDESTAL (scene_pick.xml), not the floor: z is the

# SUCCESS_MAX_SPEED, AND the in-zone-and-slow condition held for
# SUCCESS_SETTLE_STEPS consecutive control steps (debounce). A cube merely

# SUCCESS_Z_MAX down to resting height at ~0.03 m/s takes ~19 control steps,
# far more than SUCCESS_SETTLE_STEPS needs to accumulate. Contact against the
# gripper's own collision geoms is the only signal that actually
# distinguishes "held" from "released", so success also requires NO contact
# between the cube geom and any of these. (A bin_floor-contact check was
# considered instead but rejected: a cube can be set down flush on the floor
# while the jaws are still closed around it, which would pass a
# floor-contact check while still being grasped.)
# Gripper geoms are resolved by BODY MEMBERSHIP, not by a name list.
#
# This used to be a hand-maintained tuple of geom NAMES. That was a latent
# false-success bug, found in Task 5: the geom that actually collides with the
# cube -- the fixed jaw's collision mesh
# (`wrist_roll_follower_so101_gripper_part0_v1`, which spans gripper-local
# z -0.106..-0.010) -- has NO `name` attribute in the vendored MJCF, so a
# name-based list could never see it. `_is_released()` would therefore have
# reported "released" for a cube resting against that mesh while it was still
# very much in the gripper's grasp, registering a FALSE SUCCESS the moment the
# grasp started working. Names are optional in MJCF and menagerie leaves most
# mesh geoms unnamed, so any name list is structurally incomplete.
#
# Body membership has none of that failure mode: every collision geom of the
# gripper belongs to one of these two bodies by construction, named or not.
