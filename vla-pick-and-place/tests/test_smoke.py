"""THE PIPE-TEST PASS BAR (Task 9, user directive 2026-07-14).

The real fine-tune (20k steps, HF Jobs) hasn't run yet — it's blocked on HF
Jobs credits. The only checkpoint that exists right now is the Task 8
LOCAL SMOKE checkpoint: `TRAIN_SMOKE_STEPS` (5) steps on CPU, essentially
still the base model. It is EXPECTED to score ~0% — SUCCESS_RATE_FLOOR
(0.60, the real pass bar for the eventual 20k-step Hub checkpoint) does NOT
apply here and is deliberately NOT asserted below; asserting it against this
checkpoint would fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the eval
pipeline being broken.

What this test guards instead is PIPELINE MECHANICS: the checkpoint loads,
`evaluate()` rolls out N seeded episodes end to end (camera rename, action
un-normalization, sim step loop), and `eval_info.json` lands on disk with a
numeric success_rate. That is the whole deliverable for this task — proving
record -> train -> eval closes before the real fine-tune exists to grade.

Marked `slow`: it loads the 450M SmolVLA checkpoint. Run via `make smoke`.

TODO(task-9-followup): once the real 20k-step Hub fine-tune exists, repoint
this test from SMOKE_CHECKPOINT_PATH to POLICY_REPO_ID and assert
`result["success_rate"] >= SUCCESS_RATE_FLOOR` — turning this from a
pipeline-mechanics check into the real score bar.
