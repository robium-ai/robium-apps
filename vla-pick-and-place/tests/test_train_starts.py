"""Guard the training command builders and prove the loop assembles.

The command-shape tests are fast and stay in the default suite — they lock down
the flags a real spend depends on (a typo'd `--job.target` would silently run a
paid job locally, or a local smoke run would try to reach a GPU). The actual
5-step CPU loop-start is `slow` (it loads the 450M base policy) and runs via
`make train-smoke`, not in CI.
