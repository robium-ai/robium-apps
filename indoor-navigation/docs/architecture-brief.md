# Architecture Brief — indoor-navigation

**Date:** 2026-07-10   **Status:** implemented (2026-07-11)
**Author:** robium-architect subagent

## 1. Requirements

All confirmed with the user (design spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-10-nav-trial-design.md in the [robium](https://github.com/robium-ai/robium) repo);
no silent assumptions were needed.

- **Robot type:** mobile base, TurtleBot-class off-the-shelf with existing Gazebo model and
  Nav2 params. Final pick delegated to this brief → **TurtleBot 3 Burger Cam** (see §2).
- **Task:** autonomous navigation in simulation, SLAM-first pipeline: drive → build map →
  save map → Nav2 localizes on the saved map → programmatically-sent goals reached.
- **Sim vs real:** simulation only. No real robot, no sim-to-real.
- **Hardware/host:** Apple Silicon Mac (macOS/Darwin), no NVIDIA GPU → Isaac path gated off
  by both the GPU floor and the no-macOS rule. Everything runs in Docker (arm64 images).
- **Local vs remote:** local Docker, headless (no X display) → browser-based Foxglove viz.
- **Testing bar:** one-command headless smoke test (launch stack, load saved map, send nav
  goal(s), assert arrival within timeout) + lighter SLAM check (map file produced, non-trivial).
- **Layout:** self-contained app at `indoor-navigation/` at the repo root.

## 2. Chosen stack + reasoning

This is the architect skill's **navigation golden path** (`ros2` + `nav2` + `gazebo` +
`visualization`), with the headless/macOS constraints steering the leaf choices.

| Layer | Choice | Version | Why (and what was rejected) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Middleware | ROS 2 | **Jazzy Jalisco** (LTS, EOL May 2029) | Decision-tree 1: mobile base + standard drivers + package ecosystem → ROS 2. Distro: Lyrical Luth is the newer LTS, but **Nav2 has no Lyrical binaries yet** (verified open: [ros-navigation/navigation2#6123](https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/issues/6123), and no Lyrical rows on the ROS package index as of 2026-07-10) — the skill's stated exception applies, so the Nav2 vertical stays on Jazzy. Kilted rejected (non-LTS, EOL ~Dec 2026). |
| Simulator | Gazebo | **Harmonic** (LTS, paired with Jazzy) | Decision-tree 2: no NVIDIA GPU + macOS host → Gazebo is the only viable branch; Isaac Sim is hard-gated (RTX floor, Linux-only). Harmonic is the officially paired sim for Jazzy via `ros_gz`; **arm64 debs confirmed** on packages.osrfoundation.org for Ubuntu Noble. Jetty rejected (pairs with Lyrical, which Nav2 blocks). Run mode: server-only, headless rendering (see §5). |
| Robot | **TurtleBot 3 Burger Cam** | `turtlebot3_gazebo` (Jazzy binary) | The upstream model supplies lidar, odometry, and the robot-mounted camera used by the dashboard. The camera is tuned to a modest frame rate and resolution for the CPU-rendered Cloud Run path, while native macOS Gazebo renders through the local graphics stack. Switching models remains one `TURTLEBOT3_MODEL` environment variable. |
| SLAM | **slam_toolbox** | Jazzy binary (`ros-jazzy-slam-toolbox`, 2.8.x) | The Nav2-recommended and only officially supported ROS 2 SLAM library; online-async mode + `map_saver_cli` covers the drive→map→save milestone. Cartographer (the old TB3 default) rejected: effectively unmaintained upstream. |
| Navigation | **Nav2** (AMCL + planner/controller servers, `nav2_simple_commander` for goals) | Jazzy binaries | The classical nav stack for a mobile base; no learning component → no training framework (decision-tree 3, "No" branch). Goals sent programmatically via the `nav2_simple_commander` Python API (`NavigateToPose`), which is also what the smoke test drives. |
| Visualization | **Lichtblick** (browser) via `foxglove_bridge` | bundled web viewer + reusable `.foxe` control extension | Headless Docker + macOS host → no X display → RViz2 rejected per the skill's headless rule. The bridge runs beside the robot/sim and Lichtblick uses its Foxglove WebSocket protocol. The mapping layout docks the shared Robium Robot Control extension on the right. |
| Environment | **Docker** (portable/deploy) + **Pixi/RoboStack** (native macOS arm64) | `ros:jazzy` Linux image; locked community-native Jazzy packages for local Metal visualization | Docker remains the supported portable path. The native path is isolated under the app and verified on Apple Silicon without modifying system libraries. |

## 3. Module breakdown

Scaffold-pattern ROS 2 layout, pruned hard for an MVP: TurtleBot 3 upstream packages already
provide the description, sim models, worlds, and baseline params, so the app carries **one
colcon package** plus docker and tests.

**Launch composition as built (changed from draft).** Upstream
`turtlebot3_world.launch.py` is NOT headless-usable as an include — it
hardcodes a gz GUI client and non-overridable server `gz_args` — so
`sim.launch.py` composes `ros_gz_sim/gz_sim.launch.py` directly with headless
args (`-r -s --headless-rendering`) plus the upstream `spawn_turtlebot3` /
`robot_state_publisher` sub-launch includes, which are cleanly reusable.
`slam.launch.py`/`nav.launch.py` launch the Nav2 servers DIRECTLY
(`ParameterFile(allow_substs=True)`, own lifecycle manager with
`bond_timeout: 0.0`, standalone nodes + respawn) instead of including
nav2_bringup — three live-hit reasons: Jazzy `slam:=True` starts a duplicate
(sync) slam_toolbox; `navigation_launch.py` hard-codes lifecycle-manager
params so `bond_timeout` can't be set (Docker stall spikes then kill the
stack); and TB3's `$(find-pkg-share)` param substitutions break without
`allow_substs=True`. Scenario scripts `run_slam.sh`/`run_smoke.sh` wrap each
run with an outer `timeout` so no failure mode is an unbounded hang.
Params: `config/nav2_params.yaml` base is the shipped TB3
`turtlebot3_navigation2` burger.yaml with `smoother_server` grafted in and
`enable_stamped_cmd_vel: true` in all five cmd_vel-publishing sections.

Responsibilities:
- **Upstream (apt):** robot model/URDF (`turtlebot3_description`), sim worlds/models
  (`turtlebot3_gazebo`), baseline Nav2/SLAM params (`turtlebot3_navigation2`).
- **`indoor_nav_bringup`:** composition only — launch files, tuned param copies, the saved
  map, and the two thin scripts. No custom nodes unless a milestone forces one.
- **`docker/`:** one image, several compose profiles; the `environments` skill owns detail.
- **`tests/`:** the definition of done; the `testing` skill owns detail.

## 4. Comms plan

Single robot, single host — short plan. Key ROS 2 interfaces (all bridged from Gazebo via
`ros_gz_bridge` where sim-sourced):

| Interface | Type | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/scan` | `sensor_msgs/LaserScan` | ~5 Hz (TB3 LDS, 360 samples) | From gz `gpu_lidar` → needs a render engine even headless (see §8 R1) |
| `/cmd_vel` | `geometry_msgs/TwistStamped` | controller rate | **Confirmed at runtime** (bridge yaml bridges TwistStamped; manual odom drive test + full Nav2 run): TB3 Jazzy sim takes TwistStamped only; Nav2 aligned via `enable_stamped_cmd_vel: true` — §8 R3 closed |
| `/odom`, `/tf`, `/tf_static` | nav_msgs/Odometry, tf2 | ~30 Hz | odom + `map→odom` from slam_toolbox (mapping) or AMCL (nav) |
| `/map` | `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid` | latched/1 Hz | slam_toolbox during mapping; `map_server` during nav |
| `navigate_to_pose` | Nav2 action | on demand | driven by `send_goals.py` / smoke test via `nav2_simple_commander` |
| Foxglove WebSocket | `foxglove_bridge` | — | container port 8765 published to host; browser connects to `ws://localhost:8765` |

### Lichtblick control extension boundary

`shared/lichtblick-robot-control/` is deliberately outside the app so other
ROS 2 applications can package the same panel and override its saved settings.
The panel publishes plain `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist` to `/cmd_vel_teleop`; the
existing app-side `teleop_relay` remains responsible for deadman enforcement
and conversion to the simulator's stamped `/cmd_vel` contract. The persistent
`session_manager` owns restartable Gazebo and navigation process groups. It
starts only Gazebo at boot (`IDLE`), then launches exactly one SLAM or
map_server/AMCL child stack through `/mapping/start`, `/mapping/stop`, and
`/mapping/load`. Simulation selection sets `/session_manager.world` and calls
`/simulation/restart`, which tears down navigation before swapping worlds.
Maps live below `/ws/maps/<world>/`, and the advertised list is scoped to the
active world. The panel observes mode and disables invalid UI paths, while ROS
services remain the authoritative lifecycle gate.

The `.foxe` is installed once into Lichtblick Web's per-origin IndexedDB using
drag/open; generated bundles stay untracked. `make control-extension-check`
runs the extension tests, lint, build, and package gate and prints the artifact
path.

Frames: standard `map → odom → base_link → base_scan`. Transport is plain DDS topics inside
one compose network — no zenoh/gRPC needed at this scale (`integration` skill owns any change).

## 5. Environment strategy

The portable and deployment path is the single ROS 2 Docker image described
below. Apple Silicon development also has an app-local native path locked by
`experiments/native-macos/pixi.lock`: Pixi installs RoboStack Jazzy, Gazebo
Harmonic, Nav2, TurtleBot 3, and the bridge beneath the application directory;
the launcher redirects HOME, caches, temporary files, colcon build/install,
ROS logs, Gazebo logs, and the bundled viewer into that same ignored runtime.
No Homebrew package or system ROS install is required. Native Gazebo renders
through Metal while Lichtblick remains the complementary ROS-state dashboard.

- **Docker is the portable/deployment default; Pixi/RoboStack is the optional native Apple Silicon path.**
  One image: `ros:jazzy` (arm64) + apt layers: `ros-jazzy-turtlebot3*`,
  `ros-jazzy-navigation2` + `ros-jazzy-nav2-bringup`, `ros-jazzy-slam-toolbox`,
  `ros-jazzy-foxglove-bridge`, `ros-jazzy-ros-gz` (pulls Gazebo Harmonic from the OSRF repo).
  Colcon-build the one app package on top. Pin the base image digest once bringup works.
- **All images native `linux/arm64`** — no Rosetta/QEMU emulation. Gazebo Harmonic and the
  ROS 2 Jazzy buildfarm both publish arm64/Noble debs; individual package availability is
  confirmed at env-setup time (§8 R4).
- **Headless rendering:** run `gz sim -s` (server only) with headless rendering
  (EGL / mesa-llvmpipe software rendering inside the container — no host GPU is exposed).
  Required because the lidar is a render-based sensor. This is the top de-risk item (§8 R1).
- **No X anywhere.** Visualization is entirely the browser → foxglove_bridge WebSocket.
- **Reproducibility:** compose is the single entry point; `docker compose --profile <x> up`
  behaves identically anywhere Docker runs arm64 (remote Linux/arm64 reproduces; amd64 would
  need a multi-arch build — out of scope per the spec).

## 6. Data plan

Non-learning app — short plan.

- **The saved map is the app's one data artifact**: produced by the SLAM milestone
  (`map_saver_cli`), committed at `src/indoor_nav_bringup/maps/` (pgm+yaml, ~KBs), consumed
  by the nav milestone and the smoke test. Regenerating it is a documented one-command run.
- **Map-frame convention:** slam_toolbox sets the `map` origin at the robot's *starting pose*,
  not the Gazebo world origin — spawn at world (-2.0, -0.5) means world (-2.0, -0.5) = map
  (0, 0). The saved map inherits this origin, so all nav goals (send_goals.py, smoke test)
  are map-frame coordinates: `goal_map = goal_world - spawn_pose`.
- **Rosbags/logs** (debug recordings, Foxglove captures): gitignored under `bags/`.
- No datasets, no Hub pulls/pushes — `data`/`huggingface` skills not in the routing table.

## 7. Robium skills per build phase

Ordered by the design spec's milestones; testing is planned in, not bolted on.

| Phase | Skill(s) | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| Env setup | `environments` | image builds arm64; `ros2 topic list` works in container |
| Bringup (M1) | `ros2`, `gazebo` | TB3 Burger Cam spawns in the furnished house by default; `/scan` and `/camera/image_raw` publish; drivable |
| Visualization (M1) | `visualization` → `foxglove` | live `/scan` + TF in browser Foxglove |
| SLAM (M2) | `nav2` (slam_toolbox is in its orbit), `ros2` | scripted drive → map saved + committed; `tests/check_map.py` passes |
| Navigation (M3) | `nav2` | AMCL localizes on saved map; `send_goals.py` reaches goals |
| Wiring/compose | `integration` | profiles compose cleanly; cmd_vel stamping aligned (R3) |
| Testing (gate) | `testing` | one-command smoke test green headless |

**Smoke test shape** (pass bar): one command (`docker compose --profile test up
--exit-code-from smoke` or a `make smoke` wrapper) → launches sim + nav stack headless, waits
for Nav2 active, sends goal(s) via `nav2_simple_commander`, asserts `SUCCEEDED` within a
timeout sized to the measured real-time factor (R2), exits nonzero on failure.
**SLAM check** (lighter): map yaml+pgm exist; occupied and free cell counts above thresholds
(rejects an empty/degenerate map).

## 8. Risks (with outcomes at implementation, 2026-07-11)

1. **R1 — Headless GPU-less lidar rendering (top risk).** Gazebo's lidar is a `gpu_lidar`
   render-based sensor; even `gz sim -s` needs a working render engine (OGRE2 via
   EGL/llvmpipe software rendering) inside an arm64 container with no GPU. This is
   known-workable but the least-paved part of the stack. *Blocks:* everything (no `/scan`,
   no SLAM, no nav). *De-risk:* first task of M1 — assert `/scan` publishes; TB3's lidar is
   tiny (360 samples @ 5 Hz) so llvmpipe should cope; fallbacks: reduce samples/rate, pin
   mesa version, or (last resort) a remote Linux box.
   **CLOSED:** llvmpipe/EGL headless lidar rendered on the first try (`/scan` publishing,
   zero OGRE2/EGL errors); none of the fallback rungs were needed.
2. **R2 — Real-time factor under software rendering + Docker-on-macOS VM.** Sim may run
   well below 1.0 RTF. *Blocks:* smoke-test reliability (flaky timeouts). *De-risk:* measure
   RTF at M1; size all test timeouts from sim time, not wall time, where possible.
   **CLOSED:** measured RTF ≈ 0.99 in Docker-on-macOS (essentially real time); smoke
   timeout sized 180 s = ~90 s sim × 2 margin (`SMOKE_TIMEOUT` overridable).
3. **R3 — `/cmd_vel` Twist vs TwistStamped mismatch.** TB3's Jazzy Gazebo integration
   expects `TwistStamped`; Nav2's stamped-output default on Jazzy must be checked and
   aligned (`enable_stamped_cmd_vel` or a relay). *Blocks:* M3 (robot ignores commands).
   *De-risk:* verify at integration; it's a one-param or one-relay fix.
   **CLOSED:** TwistStamped confirmed at runtime (bridge type + odom drive test);
   `enable_stamped_cmd_vel: true` set in all five cmd_vel sections; robot navigates
   end-to-end under Nav2.
4. **R4 — arm64 apt coverage assumed per-package.** Buildfarm arm64/Noble coverage is the
   norm and `turtlebot3_gazebo`/`slam_toolbox`/`foxglove_bridge` Jazzy releases are
   confirmed, but each package's arm64 build wasn't individually verified. *Blocks:* env
   setup. *De-risk:* the Dockerfile build itself is the check; source-build any straggler.
   **CLOSED:** arm64 apt coverage complete — every package installed from stock
   packages.ros.org/ports.ubuntu.com; no OSRF repo or source builds needed.
5. **R5 — Foxglove web-app account/terms.** `foxglove_bridge` is MIT, but the browser app
   requires a Foxglove account (free individual tier). *Blocks:* nothing functional (viz
   only). *De-risk:* Lichtblick (open-source, same WebSocket protocol) as drop-in fallback.
   **MITIGATED:** user verified app.foxglove.dev with a free account against the live
   bridge; Lichtblick remains the untested fallback.
6. **R6 — Jazzy is a dead end for Nav2's next major.** Nav2's Lyrical release lands with a
   large refactor/user migration; this app pins Jazzy (supported to May 2029) and does not
   attempt forward-compat. *Blocks:* nothing now; a future distro bump is a real migration.
   **OPEN (unchanged):** accepted; a future migration when Nav2's Lyrical line stabilizes.
